# Rocket
A fully NPM/Yarn compatible repository, without NPM. 


I started working on Rocket after hearing about the ridiculous views of NPM's CEO. 

I also wanted something for the Node community to use that is fully 100% open source, as NPM's registry isn't. 

###Contents: 

- Contribution guidelines. 
- General code documentation. 
- Info on NPM's API. 




###Contribution guidelines. 

I am fully open to constructive pull requests and other suggestions. This is a project I am taking seriously, therefor I would greatly appreciate it if your suggestions/PR/etc's could be useful worthwhile additions. That's all I ask. 

I use Prettier in Atom, not that the IDE makes a difference. I am using Flow - take note, I am still learning Flow, so feel free to make any corrections in that department. 

Organise and document all code in your PR, so we can make properly check it out.
