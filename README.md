# Rocket
A fully NPM/Yarn compatible repository, without NPM.
<<<<<<< HEAD
<br/>

I started working on Rocket after hearing about the ridiculous views of NPM's CEO.
<br/>

Upon completion, Rocket will compatible to Yarn and NPM registry. It will host all, as many as we can host, currently available packages (most likely the popular packages for now!).
<br/>

### Progress
* currently figuring out the NPM registry login system.
  If I am not able to implement the login and file pushing system, (compatible with Yarn/NPM), I will release a small CLI for doing this.
<br/>
### Future Plans
* Working on search functionality
* package information and tarball fetching.
<br/>

### Current Stack.
+ Express,
+ MySQL with Knex & bookshelf.js

I started working on Rocket after hearing about the ridiculous views of NPM's CEO.

I also wanted something for the Node community to use that is fully 100% open source, as NPM's registry isn't.
