# Rocket
A fully NPM/Yarn compatible repository, without NPM. 


I started working on Rocket after hearing about the ridiculous views of NPM's CEO. 

Upon completion, Rocket will be compatible with Yarn, and NPM. It will host all, (as many as we can host, most likely the popular packages for now!) currently available packages. 



### My plans
--

I am currently figuring out the NPM registry login system. After I've figured this out, I will be working on search functionality and package information and tarball fetching. If I am not able to implement the login and file pushing system, (compatible with Yarn/NPM), I will release a small CLI for doing this. 



### Current Stack. 
-- 

+ Express, 
+ MySQL with Knex

Hopefully I will be able to push some working code soon, I am currently busy with college assignments. But I will make it work!
